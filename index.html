					<p>I am an IT consultant at <a href="http://www.netlight.com/en/">Netlight</a>, an independent consulting firm in Management and IT. I am currently based at the Stockholm office, but Netlight has offices in London, Munich, Oslo, and Helsinki.</p>
					<p>At Netlight, I have the chance to work with leading companies in their fields on very interesting projects. As for Netlighters, as we call ourselves, they are talented and humble consultants always eager to share their experience and knowledge.</p>

					<p>Before joining Netlight, I was a web developer at Wussap AB, an inovative Swedish startup working on <a href="http://www.netlight.com/en/">Surftrain</a>, a new social media format that offers a way of taking followers on guided tours of the Internet in a fun and engaging way.</p>
					<p>I had so much fun working with these guys and they were the main reason I fell in love with Sweden.</p>
